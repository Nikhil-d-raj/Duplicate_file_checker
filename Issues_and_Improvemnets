Limitations/Potential Issues

Does not check file content. False positives are possible if different files have the same name/size.
Temp file is stored in /tmp/seen_files.txt and may clash in multi-user environments.

Future Improvements

Add file content comparison using sha256sum or md5sum
Handle symlinks or hidden files optionally
Store logs/output in a separate file
