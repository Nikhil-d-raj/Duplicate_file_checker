❌ Repeated I/O	find and stat run many times redundantly, very inefficient.
❌ Nested Loops	For N files, time consuming.
❌ No hashing	Files with same name and size but content might not match.
❌ Break too early	A single match triggers a break, missing other duplicate files.
❌ Doesn't handle symbolic links	May follow symlinks or treat them differently.
❌ Can crash on filenames with newlines	Slightly handled by -print0, but not robust in older bash.
